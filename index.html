       <h1>Maël Guichard</h1>
       <h3><strong>Profile's</strong></h3>
       <p>I am 22 years old and currently studying in my first year at the IÉSEG School of Management in Paris. I previously worked for more than 2 years as a logistics employee in groups such as Ikea or Castorama. For more information you can click <a href="https://maelguichardcv.pagexl.com" target="_blank">here.</a>
       </p>
       <p>I'm curious about many fields like web development. I like poker, chess, sports, marketing, mathematics and science more generally.

       <h2>Psychometric marketing - Big data</h2>
       <p>I enjoy reading about <strong>marketing</strong>. And the fact that the actions of individuals can become <strong>predictable</strong> through <strong>psychometrics</strong> fascinates me. It's a field I like to learn about...

       <h2>Poker & Chess</h2>
       <p>I've always been a big player. And the two games I play mainly now are chess and poker. What I love about both games are the <strong>calculations</strong> behind them. I have a slight preference for poker where the <strong>psychological dimension</strong> comes into play.

       <h2>Sport</h2>
       <p>I've played a few sports in my life. The first was football, the second was tennis, and the last was table tennis. But I also like to watch sports games a lot. My <strong>best memory was during the Rugby World Cup in 2007 when France won against New Zealand.</strong>
